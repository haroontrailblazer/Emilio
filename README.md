# Emilio – My First EMI Calculator Project

Emilio is my very first project, built when I bought my first laptop on EMI.  
My dad didn’t tell me the exact monthly due 😭 and I was super curious…  
So I thought, “Why not build my own EMI calculator?”  
And that's how **Emilio** was born.

It's simple, lightweight, and uses a pie chart to show how your money splits into **principal**, **interest**, and **monthly payments**.

## What Emilio Does

- Lets you enter **loan amount**, **interest rate**, and **duration**
- Calculates the EMI instantly
- Shows a **clean pie chart** to visualize:
  - Principal
  - Total Interest
  - Monthly Payment
- Smooth UI made with **Streamlit**
- Dark theme (because dark mode = good vibes)

Nothing too fancy — just a clean, beginner-friendly tool that actually works

## Why I Built This

This project is special to me because:

- It was the first thing I ever built after starting Python
- I barely knew anything about UI or charts back then
- It helped me understand loan concepts in real life
- And it kind of pushed me into coding more projects later

Emilio reminds me where I started.
